# Turing-Machine-Implementation

This is a simple inmplementation of a deterministic turing machine.

+ For the course theory of languages and automata.
+ Written in C++ lang.

## Build, Run

for building your TM,see the `pdf` file to know the way to parse your TM in the `main.cc` file.<br>
next make sure you've installed `g++`(Standard C++20) and `make`(Build Automation tool).<br>
then in the main repo. directory run command below:<br>
```
make
```
and run `main` executable file.

## clean

to clean executable files in the main repo. directory run command below:<br>
```
make clean
```

### Example

The example exists in the `main.cc` file is the parse of the TM which accepts strings in `L` so that:
